d4m_Baseball
============
This is a demo script with a self-contained and tested Matlab script showing the power of [D4M](http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/D4M/) on historical Baseball data.  There are three parts:

1. **Parsing** data into a form ready for ingestion
2. **Ingesting** data into memory or an [Accumulo](http://accumulo.apache.org/) Table
3. **Querying** data to answer several questions of interest

The goal is to provide a complete, well-documented example demonstrating how to use D4M for data analysis on a data set of manageable size.  The techniques presented will scale to true *big data* scenarios.
